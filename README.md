# Fare Prediction
Predict the airline fares for the upcoming week

## Project structure
The code is inside the `src` folder with the following files:

1. **Parquet Conversion.py** - Converts csv data to parquet for reducing memory size. Not required to be run since the parquet data generated by this file is included in the repo.
2. **Preprocessing.ipynb** - Processed and merges the training and testing data with the flight schedule information. Row level features are extracted. Need to be run to generate the processed parquet files.
3. **EDA.ipynb** - Includes plots and tables for EDA
4. **Baseline LR.ipynb** - Generates a baseline mean model and a baseline linear regression model
5. **Gradient Boosting Regressor.ipynb** - Generates a tuned GBR model
6. **Random Forest Regressor.ipynb** - Generates a tune RFR model
7. **Final model.ipynb** - Generates the final model using GBR with tuned hyperparameters and creates predictions for the test data.
8. **utils.py** - Utility scripts. Update the `VALIDATION_CUTOFF` variable to run the models for different validation sets.
